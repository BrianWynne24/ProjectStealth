Created with Unreal Engine 4.26.1
Author: Brian Wynne

This project is a fan re-creation of the multiplayer mode in 'Splinter Cell: CT'. I hope to provide proof of 
concept to get other developers on board.

The game consists of Spies vs Mercs. This is a A-symmetric multiplayer game. Orignally built with maximum players
of 6 (3v3). Gadgets will be introduced to both teams with a maximum of 4 slots for gadgets. Spies will be in third person, 
and acrobatic. They will only have the ability to use a taser with limited ammo. Mercs will have lethal weapons but limited
mobility. They will be unable to traverse the map as quick as spies.
